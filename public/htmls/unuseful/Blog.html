        <p class="mainText">Pick correlation (the identiﬁcation of which part of the model is the target
           of a user’s click/tap action) is more valuable if your model is modularized
           well. If the user clicks on a single-mesh camel, the result of correlation is
           simply the identity of the camel as a whole. But if the camel is modularized,
           the result includes more detail; for example, “the shin of the front-left leg.”</p>
